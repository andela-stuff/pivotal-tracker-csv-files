# Pivotal Tracker CSV Files

[Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/) is one of the major software development tools used at Andela.

With Pivotal Tracker (PT) a project is basically comprised of *stories*. These stories can be exported to, and imported from CSV files.

The repo contains actual CSV files used to populate PT with stories with which Andela fellows are to work during the period of their *Simulations*.
